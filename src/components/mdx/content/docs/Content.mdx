# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in MDX. You can use MDX to combine Markdown with JSX (JavaScript XML) to create interactive and dynamic content.

Here's a simple list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an example of embedding code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```
